lib contains external scripts used as is
js contains custom scripts for the extension
js/browser contains different versions of the same scripts for chrome/ff

using "browser" as dir name allows to have the same manifest for both browsers
content.js is injected by background.js and therefore not declared in manifest
it is also called directly by the help popup (popup_help.html)
